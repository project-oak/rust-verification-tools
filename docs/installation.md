# Installation

Rust verification is relatively new and we are trying to use multiple
verification tools so, at least for now, these libraries have many complex dependencies.
While these will hopefully get simpler over time, at the moment, there are
currently many steps and the various instructions in this repository probably
have some errors and omissions (corrections welcome!)

Follow the following steps in order

- [Installing the Rust compiler](install-rust.md)
- [Installing KLEE and its dependencies](install-klee.md)
- [Installing crux and its dependencies](install-crux.md)
