# Using command-line arguments ("argv")

_[Note:

One important difference between C and Rust is that the C main function expects
to be given a list of command line arguments via `argc`/`argv` function
parameters while Rust programs access their command line arguments via the
`sys::env::args()` library function.

This raises the problem when verifying Rust programs of how can we pass
command line arguments to a program when we are verifying it.
This document sketches how Rust's command line arguments work (on Linux)
and how we can set them when verifying Rust programs.

## How Rust handles command-line arguments (on Linux)

_[For more information about this, see [this blog post](https://blog.mgattozzi.dev/rusts-runtime/)
and, of course, [the source code](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/library/std/src/sys/unix/args.rs).]_

The Rust runtime system provides an initializer function
`ARGV_INIT_ARRAY::init_wrapper(argc, argv, envp)` that saves the values of
`argc` and `argv` in global variables so that they can be accessed later by
`std::env::args()` and it places a pointer to this function in a global variable
in an ELF section called `.init_array_000099`.

When the Linux kernel runs a Rust program, it starts by executing code from the GNU C
library.  This library calls some initialization functions before calling the
Rust `main` function.  These initialization functions are found in ELF
sections with names like `.init_array` and they expect to be called with three
arguments: `argc`, `argv` and `envp`.


## How our tools handle command-line arguments

To make it possible to pass command-line arguments to a program when it is being
verified, we need to arrange that the initialization functions are called and that
they are passed the values of `argc` and `argv`.
(I am unsure whether we also need to pass the value of `envp`.)

Since verification tools like `KLEE` are normally used to verify C programs,
they expect to start with a call to `main(argc, argv)` so, to verify Rust programs,
we need to arrange that calling `main` will call any initialization functions.
We do this by transforming the LLVM bitcode file generated by the Rust compiler
so that the first thing that `main` does is to call all the initialization functions
and to pass them the values of `argc/argv`.
The `cargo-verify` script invokes this transformation if any command line arguments
are passed to the program.

This results in an LLVM `main` function like this (the change is the third line that calls `__init_function`).

```
define i32 @main(i32 %0, i8** nocapture readnone %1) unnamed_addr #5 {
top:
  call void @__init_function(i32 %0, i8** %1, i8** null)
  %2 = load volatile i8, i8* getelementptr inbounds ([34 x i8], [34 x i8]* @__rustc_debug_gdb_scripts_section__, i64 0, i64 0), align 1
  %3 = sext i32 %0 to i64
  %4 = call i64 @_ZN3std2rt10lang_start17ha6542edf6afbeb15E(void ()* @_ZN4argv4main17h878bf90218e36557E, i64 %3, i8** %1)
  %5 = trunc i64 %4 to i32
  call void @klee.dtor_stub()
  ret i32 %5
}
```

and the `__init_function` that calls all the initializers looks like this

```
define void @__init_function(i32 %0, i8** %1, i8** %2) {
entry:
  call void @_ZN3std3sys4unix4args3imp15ARGV_INIT_ARRAY12init_wrapper17hac2c035213cf4e54E(i32 %0, i8** %1, i8** %2)
  ret void
}
```
