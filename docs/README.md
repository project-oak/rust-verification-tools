- Usage

  - [propverify](using-propverify.md): a simple example to test
    `propverify` with.

  - [verification-annotations](using-annotations.md): how to use the
    `verification-annotations` crate directly.
    Only interesting if you want to know how `propverify` works.

  - [using KLEE](using-klee.md): how to use KLEE directly.
    Only interesting if you want to know how `cargo-verify` works.

We also recommend reading
[the proptest book](https://altsysrq.github.io/proptest-book/intro.html)
that thoroughly explains and documents the `proptest` API that `propverify` is based on.
