# Documentation


- [Installation](installation.md)
  - [Rust](install-rust.md)
  - [KLEE](install-klee.md)

- Usage
  - [propverify](using-propverify.md): a simple example to test
    `propverify` with.
  - [verification-annotations](using-annotations.md): only interesting if
    you want to know how `propverify` works.
  - [using KLEE](using-klee.md): only interesting if
    you want to know how `cargo-verify` works.

We also recommend reading
[the proptest book](https://altsysrq.github.io/proptest-book/intro.html)
that thoroughly explains and documents the `proptest` API that `propverify` is based on.
